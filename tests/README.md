# Benchmarking Robotic LLMs

Seen tasks performance: performance on tasks seen during training
Unseen tasks performance: performance on unseen tasks where the skill and object(s) were seen separately in the training set, but combined in novel ways
Robustness (distractors and backgrounds): performance with distractors (up to 9 distractors and occlusion) and performance with background changes (new kitchen, lighting, background scenes)
Long-horizon scenarios: execution of SayCan-type natural language instructions in a real kitchen
