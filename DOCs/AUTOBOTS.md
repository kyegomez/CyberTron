Here are 3 proposed model architectures for creating transformers like Optimus Prime with modern multi-modality AI:

1. Vision-Language Model

This model combines computer vision and natural language processing to enable the transformer to see and understand the visual world as well as communicate through language.

The model architecture would consist of:

- A convolutional neural network (CNN) as the visual encoder to process images and video 

- A transformer language model like BERT or GPT-3 as the text encoder

- A multimodal encoder to combine the visual and text features

- Transformer decoders for generating text and carrying out visual reasoning tasks

The model can be trained on image-caption datasets like Conceptual Captions and visual question answering datasets like VQA. Transfer learning from pretrained models like BERT and ResNet can help jumpstart the training.

2. Robotics Control Model 

This model focuses on giving the transformer capabilities to control a robotic body and manipulate the physical world.

The model architecture consists of:

- Proprioceptive sensors as input to capture the robot's internal state

- Exteroceptive sensors like cameras, lidars etc as input to perceive the environment

- Transformer networks to process spatial-temporal sensory data

- Policy networks for deciding robot actions and motion planning

- Inverse dynamics networks for low-level motor control

The model can be trained initially in simulation environments like MuJoCo or PyBullet. Then real world robot data can further refine it. Reinforcement learning can help optimize the policy and control networks.

3. Multitask Dialog Model

This model aims to enable transformers to have natural conversations and be helpful assistants.

The model architecture consists of: 

- A conversational model like DialoGPT as the backbone

- Extensions for task-focused dialog like booking flights

- An open-domain question answering module 

- A module for providing empathetic responses

- A grounded personal memory module to track its own experiences and user profile

The model can be trained on dialog datasets like MultiWOZ along with empathy datasets like EmpatheticDialogues. Reinforcement learning can further improve the assistant's ability to have human-like open-ended conversations.



Here is a mini course outline to introduce robotics to beginners:

Introduction to Robotics

1. What is a Robot?

- A robot is a machine capable of carrying out actions automatically. It consists of mechanical parts, sensors, actuators, and a controller. 

- Robots can be pre-programmed or guided by AI to handle tasks. Common applications include manufacturing, exploration, assistance.

- Example models: Industrial robot arms, autonomous cars, humanoid robots.

2. Robot Anatomy 

- Sensors: Allow robots to receive inputs from the environment like cameras, lidars. Example models: Intel Realsense, Velodyne Lidar.

- Actuators: Enable the robot to act on the environment like wheels, grippers. Example models: Dynamixel motors, robotic grippers.

- Controllers: The brain that processes sensor data and controls actuators. Can be microcontrollers or AI modules. Example models: Arduino, Nvidia Jetson.

- Body: The mechanical structure that integrates the components. Materials used include metals, plastics, composites.

3. Robot Locomotion

- Common locomotion methods: wheels, tracks, legs. 

- Wheeled: Simplest but limited mobility. Example models: Differential drive robots. 

- Tracked: High stability and traction. Example models: Tracked robot chassis.

- Legged: Most versatile mobility. Example models: quadruped and bipedal robots.

4. Robot Programming 

- Languages used: C++, Python, MATLAB.

- Approaches: Manual programming, learning-based techniques.

- Covers how to program robot behavior, motion, perception.

This covers the key concepts and components involved in robotics. The example models provide a reference for understanding real-world systems. The outline can be expanded into video or text lessons.
